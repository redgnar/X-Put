You are an experienced product manager whose task is to help create a comprehensive Product Requirements Document (PRD) based on the provided information. Your goal is to generate a list of questions and recommendations that will be used in subsequent prompting to create a complete PRD.

Please carefully review the following information:

<project_description>
# Application X-Put

### Main problem
There are too many places to enter data into apps. We need to unify them and create a single place where users can enter data in the simplest way possible.

### Minimum set of functionality
- Adding prompt to AI with required data description (some form of definition what we need to get from user).
- Using added prompt to Handle AI conversation with user to gather data - AI should have some tools to generate simple form (possible fields will be defined by system).
- Persist gathered data in some storage with relation to added propmpt (form definition).
- Fetching data from storage presenting it to user.

### What is NOT included in the MVP
- No list of forms are required.
- No captcha or other security measures.
- No user notifications.
- No user management.
- No user roles.
- No user permissions.
- No user data export.
- No user data import.
- No user data backup.

### Success Criteria
- User can enter data in the simplest way possible.

</project_description>

Analyze the information provided, focusing on aspects relevant to PRD creation. Consider the following questions:
<prd_analysis>
1. Identify the main problem that the product is intended to solve.
2. Define the key functionalities of the MVP.
3. Consider potential user stories and paths of product usage.
4. Think about success criteria and how to measure them.
5. Assess design constraints and their impact on product development.
   </prd_analysis>

Based on your analysis, generate a list of 10 questions and recommendations in a combined form (question + recommendation). These should address any ambiguities, potential issues, or areas where more information is needed to create an effective PRD. Consider questions about:

1. Details of the user's problem
2. Prioritization of functionality
3. Expected user experience
4. Measurable success indicators
5. Potential risks and challenges
6. Schedule and resources

<questions>
List your questions and recommendations here, numbered for clarity:

For example:
1. Are you planning to introduce paid subscriptions from the start of the project?

Recommendation: The first phase of the project could focus on free features to attract users, and paid features could be introduced at a later stage.
</questions>

Continue this process, generating new questions and recommendations based on the user's responses, until the user explicitly asks for a summary.

Remember to focus on clarity, relevance, and accuracy of results. Do not include any additional comments or explanations beyond the specified output format.

Analytical work should be done in the thinking block. The final output should consist solely of questions and recommendations and should not duplicate or repeat any work done in the prd_analysis section.


Questions:
1. What are the top 3 data-entry scenarios (domains/use cases) you want to support first (e.g., onboarding form, lead capture, bug report)?
   Recommendation: Prioritize one vertical for MVP and design sample form definitions for each, with explicit acceptance criteria per scenario.

2. How will the “prompt → form definition” be specified (DSL, JSON schema, natural language only)?
   Recommendation: Define a minimal JSON schema (field types, labels, constraints, dependencies) as the contract between AI and renderer to ensure determinism and testability.

3. Which field types are in scope for “system-defined possible fields” (text, number, date, select, multiselect, file, boolean, address, email, phone)?
   Recommendation: Start with a strict v1 list (text, number, date, select, boolean, email) plus validation rules, and defer complex inputs (files, signatures, addresses) to post-MVP.

4. What is the expected user flow between conversation and form—single screen with two panes (chat + live form), or stepwise tabs?
   Recommendation: Implement a two-pane layout (chat on left, dynamic form & “live summary” on right) with autosave and an always-visible “Submit” CTA.

5. How should we measure “simplest possible” data entry (time to completion, steps/clicks, clarification turns, completion rate)?
   Recommendation: Define success KPIs: median time-to-complete <3 min, ≤2 AI clarification turns per submission, ≥85% completion rate on first attempt.

6. What guardrails are required for AI (field hallucination limits, validation before persistence, user confirmation of generated fields)?
   Recommendation: Enforce a validation pipeline: AI proposes → schema validator checks → renderer displays → user confirms → only then persist data.

7. Where and how is data stored (cloud DB choice, region, encryption, PII handling, data retention)?
   Recommendation: Use a single tenant database per environment (e.g., Postgres) with field-level encryption for PII, audit logs, and a 30-day retention policy configurable per form.

8. Do we need multilingual support in conversation and labels at MVP?
   Recommendation: Support English first with i18n-ready keys; add locale switching and translation hooks so prompts and labels can be localized later without code changes.

9. What operational constraints do we have (latency targets, AI cost caps, expected daily submissions)?
   Recommendation: Set SLOs (p95 chat response <2s post-cache, form render <1s), implement rate limiting per API key, and add budget alarms for AI token spend.

10. What delivery timeline and resources are available (roles, milestone dates, test users)?
    Recommendation: Plan a 3-milestone schedule: M1 (schema + renderer) in 2 weeks, M2 (AI integration + guardrails) in 2 weeks, M3 (analytics + persistence + pilot) in 2 weeks; recruit 5–10 pilot users for usability testing each milestone.

Answers:
Ad1. Let focus on bug report form 
    e.g. {
          "description" : "Bug report form", 
          "fields" : [ 
            { "type": "text", "name" : "title", "label" : "Short description", "required" : true, "options" : {"minLength": 10, "maxLength": 200} }, "constraints": "none", "hints": "ask for meaningful minimum summary, try to give hints if the content is not understandable"},
            { "type": "text", "name" : "description", "label" : "Full description", "required" : true, "options" : {"minLength": 0, "maxLength": 65000} }, "constraints": "none", "hints": "ask for meaningful full description, try to give hints if the content is not understandable, ask for path for reproduce"},
            { "type": "datetime", "name" : "occuredAt", "label" : "Occured At", "required" : true, "options" : {} }, "constraints": "Limit only to past dates", "hints": "If the date is older than 1 month ask if the date is correct"},
            { "type": "select", "name": "priority", "label": "Priority", "required": true, options: {"options": [{"key": "low", "label": "Low"}]} }, "constraints": "allow only values from list", "hints": "none"
          ]}
Ad2. {"description" : "string", "fields" : [ { "type" : "string", "name": "string", "label" : "string", "required" : true, "options" : {} }, "constraints": "string", "hints": "string" ]}
Ad3. v1 list (text, number, date, datetime, select, boolean) plus validation rules, and defer complex inputs (files, signatures, addresses) to post-MVP
Ad4. Implement a two-pane layout (chat on left, dynamic form & “live summary” on right) with autosave and an always-visible “Submit” CTA.
Ad5. Define success KPIs: median time-to-complete <3 min, ≤2 AI clarification turns per submission, ≥85% completion rate on first attempt.
Ad6. Enforce a validation pipeline: AI proposes → schema validator checks → renderer displays → user confirms → only then persist data.
Ad7. Use a single tenant database per environment (e.g., Postgres) with field-level encryption for PII, audit logs, and a 30-day retention policy configurable per form.
Ad8. Support English first with i18n-ready keys; add locale switching and translation hooks so prompts and labels can be localized later without code changes.
Ad9. Set SLOs (p95 chat response <2s post-cache, form render <1s), implement rate limiting per API key, and add budget alarms for AI token spend.
Ad10. Plan a 3-milestone schedule: M1 (schema + renderer) in 2 weeks, M2 (AI integration + guardrails) in 2 weeks, M3 (analytics + persistence + pilot) in 2 weeks; recruit 5–10 pilot users for usability testing each milestone.

Questions:
1. For bug reports, which environment metadata should be captured (app version, OS, browser, URL, build/commit, device)?
   Recommendation: Add non-PII system fields (appVersion, os, browser, url, buildSha) as optional, auto-detected when possible and editable by the user.

2. Without user management, how should we identify/contact the reporter (anonymous vs email/Slack handle)?
   Recommendation: Include an optional “contactEmail” field with a clear privacy notice; store separately from the report body to ease future PII scrubbing.

3. How should datetime be handled across time zones and precision (seconds vs minutes)?
   Recommendation: Store all timestamps in UTC with ISO 8601; render in user’s local time; enforce “past only” with a 1-year max lookback and ask confirmation when >30 days old.

4. Do we want AI to suggest a priority level or must the user choose exclusively from the list?
   Recommendation: Expand enum to {low, medium, high, critical}; let AI preselect with a confidence note, but require explicit user confirmation before persisting.

5. Should “steps to reproduce” be a structured list and do we need “expected vs actual” fields?
   Recommendation: Add fields: stepsToReproduce (array of strings), expectedResult (text), actualResult (text) to standardize triage.

6. Do we need duplicate detection during entry to reduce repeated reports?
   Recommendation: Implement fuzzy matching on title+description against the last N submissions; if similarity > threshold, show top 3 possible duplicates and let user link instead of submit.

7. What is the versioning strategy for form definitions as they evolve?
   Recommendation: Persist formSchemaId and formSchemaVersion with each submission; maintain backward-compatible rendering and a migration note for analytics.

8. How will users retrieve and view stored bug reports if “no list of forms” is in scope?
   Recommendation: Provide a minimal “Recent Submissions” view scoped to the active form definition with search by title, date range, and priority (not a full multi-form index).

9. What guardrails should the AI use to avoid hallucinated fields and unsafe content?
   Recommendation: Validate AI-generated schema strictly against the v1 field whitelist; block unknown types; add profanity/PII detector to prompt the user to redact before submit.

10. How will we instrument KPIs (time-to-complete, turns, completion rate) reliably?
    Recommendation: Generate submissionId at session start; log events (form_rendered, ai_prompt_shown, clarification_turn, submit_clicked, persisted) with timestamps to compute KPIs and diagnose drop-offs.

Answers:
Ad1. No other fields are required now.
Ad2. The form definition should include a UUID - the reporter should use this UUID to retrieve the data after it has been submitted.
Ad3. Store all timestamps in UTC with ISO 8601; render in user’s local time; enforce “past only” with a 1-year max lookback and ask confirmation when >30 days old.
Ad4. Expand enum to {low, medium, high, critical}; let AI preselect with a confidence note, but require explicit user confirmation before persisting.
Ad5. Keep it simple, all data will be put into description
Ad6. Not needed here
Ad7. Not needed in v1
Ad8. Results are for other services, this one should focus on data entry
Ad9. Not needed in v1
Ad10. Not needed in v1

Questions:
1. How will the reporter obtain and later use the UUID (display only at submit, copy button, downloadable receipt, or also via a shareable link)?
   Recommendation: Show the UUID prominently on success, provide a one-click “Copy UUID” and a shareable, read-only URL (e.g., `/submission/{uuid}`) plus an optional printable receipt.

2. Since the UUID is the only retrieval key, what entropy/length requirements do we set to prevent guessing?
   Recommendation: Use v4 UUID (128-bit) or longer random ID; do constant-time lookups, rate-limit retrieval endpoint, and add soft IP throttling to mitigate enumeration.

3. Is retrieval read-only or can the reporter amend a submission via the UUID?
   Recommendation: Keep v1 strictly read-only; if edits are needed later, issue a separate short-lived “edit token” distinct from the permanent read UUID.

4. Where will the UUID-backed retrieval happen—public API, embedded widget, or both—and what CORS policy is needed?
   Recommendation: Expose a minimal GET `/submission/{uuid}` with JSON; default CORS deny-all and allowlist specific embed origins configured per environment.

5. With “all data in description,” how will the AI guide users to provide steps, expected/actual, and repro info without separate fields?
   Recommendation: Provide an AI-driven structured prompt template (sections: Summary, Steps, Expected, Actual, Occurred At, Priority) and validate presence of each section before submit.

6. What are the maximum sizes for the description and server payloads, and how will we handle over-limit inputs?
   Recommendation: Enforce 16–32 KB description cap in UI and API; add live character counter and compression server-side; return actionable 413 errors with guidance.

7. What failure states should the UI handle during submit/retrieval (AI failure, network timeout, storage error)?
   Recommendation: Define standard error codes and UX fallbacks: retry with backoff, local draft persistence, and a “Copy draft” escape hatch if persistence fails.

8. Do we need an expiry/retention policy tied to the UUID to avoid unbounded public retrieval?
   Recommendation: Keep 30-day default retention; after expiry, return a redacted stub (title + createdAt) with guidance to resubmit, configurable per form.

9. How will autosave and abandonment be treated without user accounts?
   Recommendation: Store a local, encrypted browser draft (IndexedDB) keyed by a client-only draftId; prompt to restore on return; discard on successful submit.

10. What minimal observability is required to support the defined SLOs without full analytics?
    Recommendation: Implement lightweight server logs for latency (p50/p95), error rates, and AI token usage per submissionId; add alerting on error spikes and SLO breaches.

Answers:
Ad1. Show only if form is submitted succesfuly or it is failed (submisionId will be used only in API)
Ad2. Use v4 UUID (128-bit) or longer random ID; do constant-time lookups, rate-limit retrieval endpoint, and add soft IP throttling to mitigate enumeration.
Ad3. Keep v1 strictly read-only
Ad4. Data will be fetched by Form UUID not submision UUID - submission UUID isnt needed now
Ad5. Provide an AI-driven structured prompt template (sections: Summary, Steps, Expected, Actual, Occurred At, Priority) and validate presence of each section before submit.
Ad6. Enforce 16–32 KB description cap in UI and API; add live character counter and compression server-side; return actionable 413 errors with guidance.
Ad7. Define standard error codes and UX fallbacks: retry with backoff, local draft persistence, and a “Copy draft” escape hatch if persistence fails.
Ad8. Not needed here
Ad9. Not needed in v1
Ad10. Implement lightweight server logs for latency (p50/p95), error rates, and AI token usage per submissionId;

Questions:
1. Retrieval scope with Form UUID only: should external services fetch a **single submission** or a **paginated list of all submissions** for that form?
   Recommendation: Define `GET /forms/{formUuid}/submissions?cursor=&limit=` returning a paginated list with minimal metadata (id, createdAt, priority) and a `GET /forms/{formUuid}/submissions/{id}` for full detail; keep IDs internal (not user-facing).

2. Public API and CORS: which origins are allowed to read by Form UUID, and is the API **public without auth**?
   Recommendation: Keep submission read endpoints server-to-server only (no browser) or require an **integration token** per form; set strict CORS allowlist and rate limits per token.

3. Internal identifiers: even if we don’t expose a submission UUID, can we persist an internal immutable **submissionId**?
   Recommendation: Generate a non-guessable internal `submissionId` (database key) for observability, logs, and troubleshooting; never surface it in the UI.

4. Schema normalization: your field examples place `"constraints"` and `"hints"` outside field objects—should these be **per-field** or **form-level**?
   Recommendation: Make them per-field:
   `{ type, name, label, required, options, constraints, hints }`. Add optional form-level `{ guidance }` for global AI instructions to avoid duplication.

5. AI prompting and guardrails: how many clarification turns may AI make before submit, and what happens if sections (Summary/Steps/Expected/Actual/OccurredAt/Priority) are incomplete?
   Recommendation: Cap at **2 clarification turns**; if sections remain missing, block submit with targeted inline tips and an example template; log a “validation_failed” event.

6. Datetime UX: “past only” with 1-year lookback and >30-day confirmation is clear—should we allow “Unknown Occurred At” when users truly can’t recall?
   Recommendation: Keep `occuredAt` required, but allow a **“Can’t recall” toggle** that sets `occuredAt=null` + reason; flag these for downstream services via `occurredAtConfidence:"low"`.

7. Priority preselection: what confidence threshold should trigger the AI’s suggested priority, and how is it shown?
   Recommendation: Show a badge “AI suggests: High (78%)” with an **explicit user choice** required; only persist after user confirms; default to **Medium** if user doesn’t pick.

8. Error model & client fallbacks: which canonical error codes will the UI handle?
   Recommendation: Standardize: `400_VALIDATION`, `401_UNAUTHORIZED`, `403_FORBIDDEN`, `404_FORM_NOT_FOUND`, `409_RATE_LIMIT`, `413_PAYLOAD_TOO_LARGE`, `422_SECTION_MISSING`, `500_SERVER_ERROR`. For 5xx, auto-retry (exponential backoff) and offer “Copy draft”.

9. Draft persistence vs. “Not needed in v1”: should the previously accepted **local draft persistence** remain, or be removed for v1 scope control?
   Recommendation: Choose one:

* **Include** minimal local draft (IndexedDB) for resilience (recommended), or
* **Exclude** drafts in v1 and rely on a single-submit flow; revisit after pilot feedback.

10. Mobile & accessibility constraints: must the two-pane layout degrade for small screens and meet a11y basics?
    Recommendation: Provide a mobile single-column fallback (chat above, summary/form below with tabs), keyboard navigation, focus states, and ARIA labels; target **WCAG 2.1 AA essentials** in v1.

Ad1. Define `GET /forms/{formUuid}/submission` in v1 i need only one submision
Ad2. Keep submission read endpoints server-to-server only (no browser) or require an **integration token** per form; set strict CORS allowlist and rate limits per token.
Ad3. `submissionId` should be also UUID for observability, logs, and troubleshooting; never surface it in the UI.
Ad4. Make them per-field (and mere it to `guidance`):
`{ type, name, label, required, options, guidance }`. Add optional form-level `{ guidance }` for global AI instructions to avoid duplication
Ad5. Cap at **2 clarification turns**; if sections remain missing, block submit with targeted inline tips and an example template; log a “validation_failed” event.
Ad6. Keep `occuredAt` required
Ad7. Show a badge “AI suggests: High (78%)” with an **explicit user choice** required; only persist after user confirms; default to **Medium** if user doesn’t pick.
Ad8. Standardize: `400_VALIDATION`, `401_UNAUTHORIZED`, `403_FORBIDDEN`, `404_FORM_NOT_FOUND`, `409_RATE_LIMIT`, `413_PAYLOAD_TOO_LARGE`, `422_SECTION_MISSING`, `500_SERVER_ERROR`. For 5xx, auto-retry (exponential backoff) and offer “Copy draft”.
Ad9. drafts in v1 and rely on a single-submit flow; revisit after pilot feedback.
Ad10. Provide a mobile single-column fallback (chat above, summary/form below with tabs), keyboard navigation, focus states, and ARIA labels; target **WCAG 2.1 AA essentials** in v1.

You are an AI assistant whose task is to summarize a conversation about PRD (Product Requirements Document) planning for MVP and prepare a concise summary for the next development stage. In the conversation history you will find the following information:
1. Project description
2. Identified user problem
3. Conversation history containing questions and answers
4. Recommendations regarding PRD content

Your task is to:
1. Summarize the conversation history, focusing on all decisions related to PRD planning.
2. Match the model's recommendations to the answers given in the conversation history. Identify which recommendations are relevant based on the discussion.
3. Prepare a detailed conversation summary that includes:
   a. Main functional requirements of the product
   b. Key user stories and usage paths
   c. Important success criteria and ways to measure them
   d. Any unresolved issues or areas requiring further clarification
4. Format the results as follows:

<conversation_summary>
<decisions>
[List decisions made by the user, numbered].
</decisions>

<matched_recommendations>
[List of the most relevant recommendations matched to the conversation, numbered]
</matched_recommendations>

<prd_planning_summary>
[Provide a detailed summary of the conversation, including the elements listed in step 3].
</prd_planning_summary>

<unresolved_issues>
[List any unresolved issues or areas requiring further clarification, if any exist]
</unresolved_issues>
</conversation_summary>

The final result should contain only content in markdown format. Ensure that your summary is clear, concise, and provides valuable information for the next stage of creating the PRD.

Summary:

<conversation_summary> <decisions>

1. MVP focuses on a **Bug Report** form with v1 field types: text, number, date, datetime, select, boolean.
2. **Schema shape** (per-field): `{ type, name, label, required, options, guidance }` with optional **form-level `{ guidance }`**.
3. **Fields in scope now**: title (text), description (text), occuredAt (datetime, required), priority (select: low/medium/high/critical). No additional fields in v1.
4. **Priority handling**: AI may preselect with confidence (e.g., “High (78%)”), but user must confirm; default is **Medium** if not chosen.
5. **Occurred At**: required; timestamps stored **UTC ISO 8601**; “past only” with **1-year** lookback; confirmation if **>30 days**.
6. **Description strategy**: all content captured in `description`; use **AI-driven structured prompt template** (Summary, Steps, Expected, Actual, Occurred At, Priority) and validate presence of sections before submit; max size **16–32 KB** with live counter; 413 guidance on overflow.
7. **Conversation limits**: max **2 AI clarification turns**; if sections still missing, block submit and log `validation_failed`.
8. **Data access model**: One submission per form endpoint: `GET /forms/{formUuid}/submission` (v1 only); read endpoints are **server-to-server** or require **per-form integration token**; strict CORS allowlist and rate limits.
9. **Identifiers**: `formUuid` is external; **internal** `submissionId` is a UUID for logs/observability only (never shown to users).
10. **UI layout**: Two-pane desktop (chat left, dynamic form & live summary right, autosave-only for submission flow); mobile **single-column** fallback (chat above; summary/form in tabs).
11. **SLOs/KPIs**: p95 chat response <2s (post-cache), form render <1s; success KPIs—median time-to-complete <3 min, ≤2 clarification turns, ≥85% first-attempt completion.
12. **Validation pipeline**: AI proposes → schema validator checks → renderer displays → user confirms → persist.
13. **Storage**: Single-tenant Postgres; field-level encryption for PII; audit logs. (Retention tied to UUID **not needed** here.)
14. **Error model & fallbacks**: Standard codes—`400_VALIDATION`, `401_UNAUTHORIZED`, `403_FORBIDDEN`, `404_FORM_NOT_FOUND`, `409_RATE_LIMIT`, `413_PAYLOAD_TOO_LARGE`, `422_SECTION_MISSING`, `500_SERVER_ERROR`; for 5xx: retry with backoff and “Copy draft” option.
15. **Drafts**: **No local drafts** in v1; single-submit flow (revisit post-pilot).
16. **Observability**: Lightweight logs for latency (p50/p95), error rates, AI token usage per submissionId.
17. **A11y/Mobile**: Keyboard navigation, focus states, ARIA labels; target **WCAG 2.1 AA essentials** in v1.
18. **Visibility of UUIDs**: Show relevant UUID only on successful or failed submission; `submissionId` remains API-only.

    </decisions>

<matched_recommendations>

1. Define a minimal JSON schema contract with strict type whitelist → **Accepted** (per-field schema + form-level guidance).
2. Two-pane UI with live summary and always-visible Submit; mobile fallback → **Accepted** (plus a11y).
3. KPIs and SLOs for “simplest possible” data entry → **Accepted** (time-to-complete, turns, completion rate; p95 targets).
4. Validation pipeline and guardrails to prevent hallucinated fields → **Accepted** (schema validation + confirm before persist).
5. UTC timestamps, past-only constraint with 30-day confirmation → **Accepted** (plus 1-year lookback).
6. AI suggests priority but user confirms; default Medium → **Accepted**.
7. AI-driven structured prompt to keep description simple yet complete → **Accepted** (section presence validation).
8. Payload size limits and actionable 413 responses → **Accepted** (16–32 KB cap + live counter).
9. Secure read model (integration tokens, strict CORS, rate limits) → **Accepted**.
10. Lightweight observability on latency, errors, AI tokens; internal-only submission UUID → **Accepted**.
    </matched_recommendations>

<prd_planning_summary>
a. **Main functional requirements**

* **Form definition & rendering**: Support bug-report form via strict schema `{ type, name, label, required, options, guidance }` and optional form-level guidance.
* **AI-led capture**: Conversational assistant guides the user using a structured template (Summary, Steps, Expected, Actual, Occurred At, Priority), with ≤2 clarification turns.
* **Validation & submission**: Enforce section completeness, schema validation, and explicit priority confirmation; timestamps are UTC, past-only with 1-year lookback and >30-day confirmation.
* **Storage & retrieval**: Persist submissions in Postgres with encryption and audit logs. Expose `GET /forms/{formUuid}/submission` for server-to-server (or token-protected) retrieval; internal `submissionId` (UUID) for observability only.
* **UI/UX**: Desktop two-pane (chat + live summary/form) and mobile single-column fallback (tabs). Accessibility per WCAG 2.1 AA essentials. Show relevant UUID post success/failure only.
* **Limits & errors**: Description capped at 16–32 KB; standard error codes with retries/backoff and “Copy draft” on failures. No local drafts in v1.

b. **Key user stories & paths**

* As a **reporter**, I can:

    1. Open the bug form, chat with AI to fill required sections, review live summary, confirm priority, and submit successfully within ~3 minutes.
    2. Receive confirmation (and relevant UUID display) after success or failure.
* As an **integrating service**, I can:

    1. Retrieve the single latest/only submission via `GET /forms/{formUuid}/submission` using an integration token.
    2. Trust consistent schema and timestamps for downstream processing.
* As an **operator**, I can:

    1. Monitor latency, error rates, and AI token usage via logs keyed by internal `submissionId`.
    2. Investigate issues using standardized error codes.

c. **Success criteria & measurement**

* **Completion**: ≥85% first-attempt completion rate (from submission event logs).
* **Speed**: Median time-to-complete <3 minutes; p95 chat response <2s, form render <1s (instrumented server/client timings).
* **Quality**: ≤2 AI clarification turns; section presence validator pass rate; low 4xx/5xx error rates.
* **Reliability**: Observed p95 latency SLO met; controlled rate-limiting events; minimal 413 occurrences post-guidance.

d. **Unresolved issues or clarifications needed**

* Ask about `POST /forms` endpoint that creates form definition.
* Ask about `POST /forms/{formUuid}/submission` endpoint that creates submission.`
* Confirm whether `GET /forms/{formUuid}/submission` returns **the most recent** submission or a **unique single submission per form** (v1 implies one submission total).
* Clarify whether `GET /forms/{formUuid}/submission` returns **the most recent** submission or a **unique single submission per form** (v1 implies one submission total).
* Specify exact **description size limit** (choose 16 KB vs 32 KB) and whether server compression is enabled for storage vs transport.
* Define UI copy for **>30-day occurredAt confirmation** and for **validation_failed** messages (tone and examples).
* Confirm whether the “Copy draft” fallback is acceptable despite **no drafts in v1** (it copies current input without persistence).
* Decide on **integration token format & rotation** policy (TTL, scope per form, revocation process).
* Confirm **autosave behavior** in the two-pane UI given “no drafts” (submit-only flow vs transient in-memory state).
  </unresolved_issues>
